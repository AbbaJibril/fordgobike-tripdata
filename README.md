## Summary of Findings

In the course of my exploration, I found out that there were more trips on week days thank weekends. However the duration of these trips is less than the trips on weekends. 
Additionally, There were trips during rush hours. 
A significant number of the trips wre taken by male users, and subscribers. However, the 'other' gender tend to take more trip duration than Male and Female. Also, Customers spend more time on trips that subscribers, and tend to have more flexility with their time.


## Key Insights for Presentation

* Most trips were taken on weekdays, with weekends having the lowest trip records.
* There are more trips between the 7th and 9th hours, and the 16th and 18th hours. This may be due to people's rush to and from work.
* Customer have more time flexibilty than Subscribers.
* Weekends have more longer duration trips
